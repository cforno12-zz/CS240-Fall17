#+TITLE: Pointers

* Declaring Pointers
  - Syntax: <data type> *<pointer name>;
  - Bound to a type
    - you can create a void pointer called "casting"
* Assigning a Value to a Pointer variable
  - value of a pointer is a memory address
  - Assign to a pointer the address of an exisiting variable
    - src_C++{ int number = 17; intPointer = &number; cout << intPointer; }
    - This prints out the memory address, not "17".
  - Use 'new' to request space at run-time.
    - intPointer = new int; -- gives the intPointer an anonymous VALUE.
* Dereferencing
  - *intPointer = 36;
  - '*' = goes from address to value (also declares a pointer type)
  - '&' = goes from value to address
